#summary Summary of the testbenches that the Adelaide team has put together

Currently the Adelaide team has been writing its testbenches for IRSIM, and running them under electric, as the ModelSim dev environment on our PCs does not have support for verilog at this stage.

All the tests are located in subversion, at [http://hmc-mips.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/testing/adelaide/ testing/adelaide].

The following testbenches were written by Mel.

  * test_adrtagdatalogic

  * test_dataout_write
  * test_mux2_1x_32
  * test_mux2_4
  * test_mux2_c_1x
  * test_mux2_dp_1x
  * test_mux2_zip

Rob has masterfully wirtten this to get some coverage on the srambit, to assist the Mudders in getting this module simulating before their deadline.

There is a quirk in the IRSIM testing that requires explicitly setting certain lines to `x` (floating), not 100% sure why this is.
