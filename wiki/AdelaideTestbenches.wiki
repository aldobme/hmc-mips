#summary Summary of the testbenches that the Adelaide team has put together

Currently the Adelaide team has been writing its testbenches for IRSIM, and running them under electric, as the ModelSim dev environment on our PCs does not have support for verilog at this stage.

All the tests are located in subversion, at [http://hmc-mips.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/testing/adelaide/ testing/adelaide].

The following testbenches were written by Mel.

  * test_adrtagdatalogic
  * test_byteenlog
  * test_dataout_read
  * test_dataout_write
  * test_mux2_1x_32
  * test_mux2_4
  * test_mux2_c_1x
  * test_mux2_dp_1x
  * test_mux2_zip

This testbench provides coverage for the srambit.

It provides all the required functionality, however there is a small issue with having to set lines to `x` (floating). He tried to make it work like the description in the text book, however it still requires manually setting some signals to `x`. Unsure if the circuit was supposed to do this on its own, but it doesn't work unless they are explicitly set.

This testbench is auto-generated by [http://hmc-mips.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/testing/adelaide/DecoderBench.java DecoderBench.java].

The first test tests each decoder input with a randomly chosen clock input, in lexicographic order.
The second test tests each decoder input with a 1 value for the clock.
