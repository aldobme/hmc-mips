#summary Guide to the Verilog testing method.

= Running Test =

  # In the Xilinx ISE, select the sources for "Behavioral Simulation"
  # Select the testbench module
  # Under "Modelsim Simulator" Double-click "Simulate Model Behavior"
  # Modelsim should start.  If the simulation does not automatically run, type "run 100000ns"
  # Something like the following should be printed:
{{{
# Simulation           0 succeeded
# Simulation           1 succeeded
# Test complete
}}}

= Viewing More Internal Objects =

By default Modelsim will optimize and not make it possible to view most internal components of thse simulation (in a waveform view for example).  

You can bypass this (while also making the simulation slower) by doing the following:

The vopt (opimization) command can control the visibility of components.  The +acc flag determines which components are visible.  Type {{{vopt -help}}} to see the various components that +acc controls.  In the following example "rn" refers to registers and nets. 

To make these things visible, once Modelsim is open, type this into the console:

{{{
vopt +acc=rn testbench -o testbench_debug
}}}

Switch to optimized mode with 

{{{
vsim testbench_debug
}}}

Finally run the command as usual.
