#summary Detailed specifications for the MIPS memory system

= Introduction =

This specifies the memory subsystem, including the data and instruction cache.


= Overview =

Two 4kB caches, one for data and one for instructions.  

  * Create (identical) direct-mapped write-back instruction and data caches
  * Support cache bypassing (via upper bits of memory address)
  * Support cache swapping (using the swc bit available in the status register)
  * Support cache isolation (using the isc bit available in the status register) 

= Cache Specifications =

Each cache will be 4kB in size.  The cache will be of the following type:

  * _Write-through_: When data is written to an address, it is written immediately to memory as well as the cached.  The cache never has an newer copy of data than main memory.
  * _Write buffer_: To improve performance, so the CPU does not stall for the entire memory write latency, a FIFO (first-in first-out) write buffer is used.  Once the write buffer is full, the CPU must stall.
  * _Direct-mapped_: The lower bits (how many bits?) of the memory address will be used as the tag in the cache memory.
  * _Physically addressed_: The memory address the cache uses is based upon the physical address, the actual address in RAM, not a program address which is translated.
