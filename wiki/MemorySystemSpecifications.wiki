#summary Detailed specifications for the MIPS memory system

= Introduction =

This specifies the memory subsystem, including the data and instruction cache.


= Details =

  * Create (identical) direct-mapped write-back instruction and data caches
  * Support cache bypassing (via upper bits of memory address)
  * Support cache swapping (using the swc bit available in the status register)
  * Support cache isolation (using the isc bit available in the status register)
