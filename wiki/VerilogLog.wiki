I believe I misinterpretted the sltiu command.  I originally added an enable slot to the immediate sign extender so that the immediate can be turned off for these unsigned instructions.  I can't find any reference to this issue in See MIPS Run, but [http://www.mrc.uidaho.edu/mrc/people/jff/digital/MIPSir.html this website] says that all immediate values are first sign extended and then treated as signed or unsigned.  I believe only a certain set of intrsuctions have their immediates sign extended.  Page 223 of See MIPS Run for example shows "signed" and "unsigned."  PCSPIM seems to behave in a way consistent with those instructions being zero-extended.

I implemented some of the immediate instructions.  I am becoming better at debugging, so my speed of development should start to pick up more and more.

Now that I'm starting to get into the nitty-gritty of implementation, I'm going to try to document my work.

I am starting off with basics, in particular the immediate instructions.  I just read in See MIPS Run (page 178) that I misinterpreted the meaning of the "u" in some instructions like addu and subu.  I assumed it meant "unsigned," but in fact some of the time it means something like "no overflow test."  See MIPS Run says it is very unliked that the non-suffixed versions (e.g. "add") will ever be generated by a compiler.  Therefore I plan to remove these instructions from the instruction set (or just make them replicas of "addu" etc).
