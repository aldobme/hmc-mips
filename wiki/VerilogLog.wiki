Now that I'm starting to get into the nitty-gritty of implementation, I'm going to try to document my work.

I am starting off with basics, in particular the immediate instructions.  I just read in See MIPS Run (page 178) that I misinterpreted the meaning of the "u" in some instructions like addu and subu.  I assumed it meant "unsigned," but in fact some of the time it means something like "no overflow test."  See MIPS Run says it is very unliked that the non-suffixed versions (e.g. "add") will ever be generated by a compiler.  Therefor I plan to remove these instructions from the instruction set (or just make them replicas of "addu" etc).
