#   Tests basic read/write functionality of cache system
#   and write buffer.
#
# Steps:
# 1. Test consecutive uncached writes.  Then reads values back
#   from memory and verifies correct values.
#  
# 2. Test cached writes.  Then reads values back from memory and
#    verifies correct values.
