Each student at Level IV of the course in Electrical and
Electronic Engineering, Computer Systems Engineering and
Telecommunications Engineering is required to complete this course.
The course involves approximately 240 hours of project work over the
whole academic year.  Students are assessed on their performance in
the project, a written proposal, this written report, a technical
paper, and two seminar presentations.

\section*{Objectives}
The MIPS architecture is popular Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) microarchitecture, utilised in many commodity hardware sytems.
\\In collaboration with Dr David Money Harris' VLSI Design class from Harvey Mudd College, California, the project involves implementation of the MIPS R2000-class microprocessor to be fabricated by MOSIS. Our team will focus on the cache memory system, followed by projects utilising the fabricated hardware.
\\The testbed containing the microprocessor and supporting perephials will be packaged in a form that will enable it to be used as a promotional tool, as well as for demonstrating the unit.

\section{Background and Significance}

The first aim of this project is to co-operate with the VLSI class
from Harvey-Mudd College, California, to design and build a MIPS-based
microprocessor.

Microprocessors are electronic devices that contain all the functions
of a CPU on a single integrated circuit. This microprocessor will be
split into a control unit, a coprocessor and a data path. The datapath
contains a fetch, decode, execute and memory stage. The Adelaide team
is designing the 512kB cache for the memory stage. A cache stores
recently used memory data on chip to save slow memory accesses. The
cache is direct mapped, meaning that each datum from memory has a
unique place it can be stored in the cache.

The chip will use a MIPS R2000 instruction set architecture
(ISA). MIPS stands for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline
Stages. The MIPS ISA is a popular RISC microprocessor
architecture. R2000 has 32-bit instructions including various loads,
stores, arithmetic, jumps and branches, shifts, moves and exceptions.

In the production of a microprocessor testing is required on both the
design and the finished hardware.
