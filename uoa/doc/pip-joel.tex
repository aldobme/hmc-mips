\section{Budget}

There is an allocation of \$250 per student, making the team budget
\$1000. We have identified one major item to purchase,
that being a Xilinx XCV2P Virtex-II Pro FPGA board. The cost per board is
US\$299, approximately \$370. We need two of these boards, plus a portable housing for the testbed setup to enable easy transportation and demoing of the system.

There may be a requirement to purchace additional hardware components to enable connection of the two FPGA boards together.
